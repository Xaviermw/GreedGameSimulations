Players compete to steal the most "double treasure" without getting caught and forced to walk the plank. Each round players alternate choosing from a pool of treasure that include single treasures equal to the amount of players in the game (minus one in every round but the first), and one double treasure. After each round the players vote one person they suspect to have taken the treasure and if that person has, they are eliminated, and the next round begins with the leftover card being put into the new pool. Play procedes until one person has stolen enough double treasure (defaut value is 3), or all players are eliminated except 2 in which case the players "duel" (the player with the most stolen up to that point wins).

All games here simulate players who play with different game strategies in order to verify fun outcomes (notably that ties aren't rampant, and duels too rampant).

Edit the variables in run_game.py to change amount, type of players, or default suspicion ratings.
